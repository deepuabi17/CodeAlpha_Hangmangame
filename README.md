# CodeAlpha_Hangmangame
The Hangman game is a classic word-guessing game that is both fun and educational. 
#Objective:
The goal of the game is to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before the hangman is fully drawn.
#Rules:
Setup: The game selects a word, and the player sees a series of blank spaces representing each letter of the word.
Guesses: The player guesses letters one at a time.
Correct Guess: If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed in the correct positions.
Incorrect Guess: If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman (a stick figure) is drawn.
Winning: The player wins if they guess the word before the hangman is completely drawn.
Losing: The player loses if the entire hangman is drawn before the word is guessed.
